# THIS IS A PoC WIP REPO AND IS NOT READY FOR USE YET

For use with HomebrewWebFramework (can't link it here).

This provides a simple framework for making easy to use installable video players for Nintendo Switch. Videos are (obviously) not provided, but easy to make and instructions can be found under the **Encoding** header.

# Usage


# Encoding
Follow these directions to make the most reliable videos.

The recommended tool is Handbrake. Enable these settings, and optionally make a preset for easier encoding.

- Set video resolution to 1280 x 720
- Enable the "Web Optimized" setting
- Output as .mp4
- If using subtitles, make sure to choose the "burn-in" option.
- Only encode one audio and video track into the file

# FAQ and Troubleshooting

**Q: Why can't you link to HomebrewWebFramework?**

A: I just can't. Don't ask me to provide it, because I won't.

**Q: The NSP keeps freezing my Switch when it is launched. What do?**

A: Make sure to enable the "select user on launch" option in the builder.

**Q: Tinfoil says that the NCA is invalid. What do?**

A: Try building with another keygen. 4.0.1-4.1 works well in my experience.

**Q: Your GUI is too simple.**

A: Make a better one and make a pull request.
